        <b>Beagles</b> are small to medium-sized dogs with short, smooth coats that come in a variety of colors, including white, black, brown, and tan. They are known for their friendly and playful personalities, and they make great family pets. Beagle dogs are also very intelligent dogs, and they are easy to train.
        <em><b>Beagles</em></b> are originally from England, and they were bred to track small game, such as rabbits and foxes. This can lead them astray if they catch a scent during outdoor walks, so owners should ensure their dogs are on a leash to prevent them from wandering too far. They are still used for hunting today, but they are also popular as companion dogs. This breed are relatively low-maintenance dogs, and they require regular exercise and grooming.
